# SavjeeCoin (front-end)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Savjee/savjeecoin-frontend.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Savjee/savjeecoin-frontend)

[Live Demo](https://savjee.github.io/savjeecoin-frontend/)

Angular application that allows you to interact with a blockchain. You can see the blocks on chain, see transaction within them and even create new transactions and mine blocks.

*This is for educational purposes only. This is by no means a complete blockchain implementation (nor does it aim to be one). Use it to learn how blockchains operate.*
